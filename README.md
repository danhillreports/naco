"Draw the Border!" and "Naco or Naco?" are border cities quiz games built for [Migrahack](http://www.chicagomigrahack.com/). 

See them in action by viewing the files draw.html and naco.html respectively.

The prototypes were slapped together in a matter of hours, so I'm here to make improvements like:

+   add border cities/levels
+   improve map interaction/make drawing the border not suck
+   add more meaningful city data

I also am using this as an opportunity to experiment with Backbone. Please fork or Tweet me [@DanHillReports](http://twitter.com/danhillreports) if you have ideas!
